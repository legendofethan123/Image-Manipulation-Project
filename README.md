# Image-Manipulation-Project
2d dimensional arrays
creating an application which is able to modify images as well as create new images using 2D arrays! The first section covers stretching the image horizontally, shrinking the image vertically, negating the color, applying a color filter, and inverting the image. The second section covers creating an image consisting of random pixels, placing a rectangle in the image, and using the method to randomly place many rectangles in the image.
